## Whats The Issue?

I was trying to update my system using `sudo apt update` and I got the following error:

![ssh tunneling](/static/images/github_cli_expired_gpg/error_image.png)

This error was due to expired GPG keys of GitHub Cli tool gh.

You can read more about this issue on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/6175).

## Solution

You will first need to remove the expired GPG keys from your system. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-key del C99B11DEB97541F0
```

NOTE: C99B11DEB97541F0 is the expired GPG key.

You may see a Warning message like this:

```bash
Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)).
```

You can ignore this warning. This is because the `apt-key` command is deprecated and you should use `gpg` instead. But for now, we will use `apt-key` to remove the expired GPG keys as it solves our issue.

After that remove the GitHub Cli repository from your system by running the following command:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list
```

Now you can try to update your system using `sudo apt update` command. It should work now.

## Install Latest Version of GitHub Cli

Now, if you want you can install latest version of GitHub Cli by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install gh
```
