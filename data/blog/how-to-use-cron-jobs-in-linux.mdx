## What is Cron Job

Cron is a job scheduler available in Unix-like operating systems. It is used to schedule jobs to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

## How to use Cron Jobs

### 1. Cron Job Syntax

Cron jobs are scheduled using a syntax that defines five fields. The fields are separated by spaces and represent:

- Minute (0-59)
- Hour (0-23)
- Day of the month (1-31)
- Month (1-12)
- Day of the week (0-6)

### 2. Cron Job Examples

#### 2.1. Run a command every 5 minutes

```bash
*/5 * * * * command
```

#### 2.2. Run a command every 5 minutes between 8am and 5pm

```bash
*/5 8-17 * * * command
```

#### 2.3. Run a command every 5 minutes between 8am and 5pm on Monday to Friday

```bash
*/5 8-17 * * 1-5 command
```

#### 2.4. Run a command every 5 minutes between 8am and 5pm on Monday to Friday in January

```bash
*/5 8-17 1 * 1-5 command
```

### 3. Cron Job Editor

Cron jobs can be edited using the `crontab` command. The `crontab` command is used to install, deinstall, and list the crontabs of the current user.

#### 3.1. List Cron Jobs

```bash
crontab -l
```

#### 3.2. Edit Cron Jobs

```bash
crontab -e
```

After running the above command, you will be prompted to select an editor. Select your preferred editor and add your cron jobs.

#### 3.3. Remove Cron Jobs

```bash
crontab -r
```
